In case I forget as time goes by, the URL for this plugin in jEdit's SVN is

  https://svn.code.sf.net/p/jedit/svn/plugins/InputReplace/trunk

and so I can check it out with

  svn co --username jpavel --password xxxxxxxx ^
      https://svn.code.sf.net/p/jedit/svn/plugins/InputReplace/trunk

And I can tag a release by doing an

  svn copy https://svn.code.sf.net/p/jedit/svn/plugins/InputReplace/trunk ^
           https://svn.code.sf.net/p/jedit/svn/plugins/InputReplace/tags/inputreplace-X.X.X ^
           -m "Tagging the X.X.X release of InputReplace"
