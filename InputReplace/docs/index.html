<h2>1. Overview</h2>

The InputReplace plugin provides a facility for expanding input character sequences
into replacement text, similar to abbreviations but without the requirement of
expanding a whole word at a time. It is useful for inserting characters not found
in your keyboard layout, such as turning "e'" into "é" or "c/" into "¢". One can
also define BeanShell functions to perform more complicated replacements, for instance
turning characters into codepoints and vice-versa:<br><br>
<tt>
&nbsp;&nbsp;"(É)U-" -> "0xC9"<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;"(0xC9)U+" -> "É"
</tt>

<h2>2. Defining the Replacement Table and User Functions</h2>

When you first install the plugin, a default replacement table will be set up, as
well as a few BeanShell functions that you can use in your replacements. The table
and user functions can be edited by the "Edit Replacement Table" and "Edit User
Functions" actions in the Plugins menu.

<h3>2.1 Replacement Table</h3>

The format of the replacement table is given in the table text file itself, but is
copied here for reference:
<blockquote>
<pre>
# This file maps input strings to character compositions, like a simple
# input method. Only non-whitespace characters may be used for the input
# string (the replacement text may contain whitespace). The format of the
# table is a series of lines, where the input strings appear at the start
# of each line, followed by whitespace, and then the output string. Lines
# that are JUST a hash mark, or that begin with a hash AND a space, are
# comments (since abbreviations are at minimum two characters long, this
# doesn't affect the table at all). Lines that are all whitespace are
# ignored.
#
# Instead of a replacement string, you can use a special notation,
# U+HHHH or U+10HHHH to represent a Unicode character expressed in hex.
#
# You can also use a special form as the replacement string, which is
#      (&lt;function name&gt;)FUNC
# which will use BeanShell to evaluation &lt;function name&gt;, passing in as
# an argument the text in the document contained between '(' and ')'.
# Actually, the parentheses can be any characters, and the document text
# will be scanned to find the opening and closing delimeters. Example:
#   FB	|foobar|FUNC
# will match the document form |analyze|FB, and call foobar("analyze")
</pre>
</blockquote>

<h3>2.2 User Functions</h3>

The BeanShell script installed with the plugin will give you a good idea of how your
own functions should be structured. Basically, each function takes one parameter, a
String representing the input, and returns a transformed String. You then reference
it in the replacement table using the <tt>"(&lt;function name&gt;)FUNC"</tt> syntax.

<h3>2.3 Reloading</h3>

When you change the replacement table or user-function script, you'll need to use
the "Reload Table and Functions" action to have the plugin load your changes.

<h2>3. Usage</h2>

The way that the "Input Replace at Caret" action works is primarily what differentiates
this plugin from abbreviations. Instead of examining the previous <i>word</i>, it operates
on non-whitespace characters in this fashion:
<ol>
    <li>Set the <i>point</i> to <tt>max-length</tt> characters before the caret.
    <tt>max-length</tt> is settable in Plugin Options, and defaults to 8.</li>
    <li>Check if the text between the point and the caret has an entry in the replacement
    table; if so, perform the replacement and we're done.</li>
    <li>Otherwise, if there are still more than 2 characters between the point and caret,
    advance the point one character and try again. (The minimum length of a replacement
    entry is 2 characters)</li>
</ol>
This allows you to define, say, a single replacement <tt>e' </tt>-><tt> é</tt> and use it
to quickly enter both <i>café</i> and <i>débutante</i>. To enter café, you would type
<tt>cafe'</tt> and activate "Input Replace at Caret" after the whole word; to enter
débutante, you would type <tt>de'</tt>, activate "Input Replace at Caret", and then finish
typing the word.
<p/>
You can, of course, define whole words as input and replacement text, as with abbreviations
(though without any positional parameters).
<p/>
I recommend binding "Input Replace at Caret" to an easy key-combination, since you'll need
to activate it often, if you write a lot of accented text.
