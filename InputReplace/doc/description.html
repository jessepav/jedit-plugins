<body>
The InputReplace plugin provides a facility for expanding input character sequences
into replacement text, similar to abbreviations but without the requirement of
expanding a whole word at a time. It is useful for inserting characters not found
in your keyboard layout, such as turning "e'" into "é" or "c/" into "¢". One can
also define BeanShell functions to perform more complicated replacements, for instance
turning characters into codepoints and vice-versa:<br><br>
<tt>
&nbsp;&nbsp;"(É)U-" -> "0xC9"<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;"(0xC9)U+" -> "É"
</tt>
